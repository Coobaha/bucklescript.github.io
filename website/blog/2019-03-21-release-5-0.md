title: bs-platform release v5
---

`bs-platform@5.0.0` is released! There are quite a few bug fixes in this release  and refmt is synced up, a detailed list of changes is available [here](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript/blob/master/Changes.md#500).


Several new features are introduced in this release:

- first class `bs.variadic` support, documented [here](https://bucklescript.github.io/blog/2019/03/1/feature-preview)

- we prebuilt binaries for Windows, MacOS and Linux, this will help reduce your CI build time significantly. For exotic OSes, it will fall back to build from source

- bs.deriving light config. For people who prefer short names, we make it configurable

```
type t = {
    x : int
} [@@bs.deriving {abstract = light}]

let f (obj : t) = obj |. x 
```

This is the last major release which is targeting OCaml 4.02.3, in the future we will make major releases targeting OCaml 4.06. 

Happy Hacking!
